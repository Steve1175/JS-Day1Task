Basics of HTTPS:

HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. It is the most common protocol for sending
data between a web browser and a website. It is the secure variant of HTTP used for communication
between the browser and the webserver.  In order to make the data transfer more secure, it is 
encrypted. Encryption is required to ensure security while transmitting sensitive information 
like passwords, contact information, etc. 

How Does HTTPS Work?

HTTPS is a secure variant of HTTP that encrypts data before it is sent. It functions by encrypting
the data you transmit and receive online. The browser and the server work together to create a secure
connection when a user requests a web page served over HTTPS.

HTTPS is commonly used to protect confidential information on websites, such as credit card numbers, 
passwords, or other sensitive information. It is also becoming increasingly popular for protecting 
non-confidential information, such as general web browsing activities. This is because newer browsers 
are starting to mark sites that use HTTP as “not secure” to encourage HTTPS use further.

How HTTPS Works Step by Step:

Step 1: The client (such as a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the web server.

Step 2: The web server receives the request and responds with a digital certificate as an SSL Certificate
containing a public key.

Step 3: The client verifies that the certificate is valid, and if so, it uses the public key to encrypt 
and send back its own symmetric key. This is known as a “handshake” between the two parties.

Step 4: The server then decrypts this symmetric key using its private key, giving it access to all messages
sent from the client.

Step 5: The server and client then use the symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt all messages sent between
them, ensuring that no one else can intercept and read them.

Step 6: When the communication is complete, both parties discard the symmetric key. This ensures that any 
further communications must be re-encrypted with a new key.

How Is HTTPS Different From HTTP?

The secure variant of the HTTP protocol is called HTTPS, by which webpages are shared over the internet.
While HTTPS and HTTP may appear similar to the everyday user, they have a few distinct differences; 
most importantly, HTTPS data is encrypted during transmission.

HTTPS uses TLS/SSL certificates to encrypt data before sending it over a connection. This encryption adds 
extra security for critical connections, such as banking or entering credit card information. Encryption 
does, however, slow down page loading times compared to non-secured websites using HTTP, which is one of
the downsides to using HTTPS instead of HTTP. Authentication also helps distinguish legitimate websites
from malicious ones, helping protect against malicious activities like phishing and spoofing.
